# 89 — Update PATH Sync

> Spec for the automatic binary sync step during `gitmap update`.

---

## Problem

On Windows, the compiled binary is deployed to a subdirectory (e.g., `E:\bin-run\gitmap\gitmap.exe`), but the system PATH may resolve to a different copy at the parent level (e.g., `E:\bin-run\gitmap.exe`). After a successful build-and-deploy, the active PATH binary remains stale, producing:

```
[FAIL] Active PATH version does not match deployed version.
```

---

## Solution

The update script now includes an **auto-sync** step between the deploy and verification phases. It compares the deployed binary against the active PATH binary and copies the newer version into the PATH location.

---

## 3-Step Sync Strategy

The sync runs inside the auto-generated PowerShell update script (`UpdatePSSync` constant).

### Step 1 — Detect Mismatch

1. Resolve the **active binary** via `Get-Command gitmap` (PATH lookup).
2. Resolve the **deployed binary** from the deploy target directory.
3. Compare their absolute paths — if identical, no sync is needed.
4. Run `gitmap version` on both — if versions match, no sync is needed.

### Step 2 — Copy-Item (Primary)

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path $resolvedDeployed -Destination $resolvedActive -Force
```

This is the default sync method. It overwrites the stale PATH binary with the freshly built one. Works in most cases where the file is not locked.

### Step 3 — Rename-Then-Copy Fallback

If `Copy-Item` fails (file lock, permission denied):

1. Rename the locked active binary to `gitmap.exe.old` via `Move-Item`.
2. Copy the deployed binary to the active path via `Copy-Item`.
3. If the copy fails after rename, restore the `.old` backup automatically.

```powershell
Move-Item -Path $resolvedActive -Destination "$resolvedActive.old" -Force
Copy-Item -Path $resolvedDeployed -Destination $resolvedActive -Force
```

### Step 4 — Kill Stale Processes and Retry

If the rename fallback also fails:

1. Query `Win32_Process` for all `gitmap.exe` processes except the current PID.
2. Terminate each stale process via `Stop-Process -Force`.
3. Wait 500ms for handles to release.
4. Retry `Copy-Item`.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='gitmap.exe'" |
    Where-Object { $_.ProcessId -ne $PID } |
    ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.ProcessId -Force }
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
Copy-Item -Path $resolvedDeployed -Destination $resolvedActive -Force
```

### Step 5 — Manual Hint

If all automated strategies fail:

```
[WARN] Still could not sync: <error>
[HINT] Run 'gitmap doctor --fix-path' manually.
```

## Script Execution Order

The update PowerShell script is assembled from template constants in this order:

| Order | Constant               | Purpose                                        |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `UpdatePSHeader`       | Set working directory to source repo            |
| 2     | `UpdatePSDeployDetect` | Resolve deployed binary path from config/PATH   |
| 3     | `UpdatePSVersionBefore`| Capture pre-update version of active binary     |
| 4     | `UpdatePSRunUpdate`    | Execute `run.ps1 -Update` (build + deploy)      |
| 5     | **`UpdatePSSync`**     | **Auto-sync deployed → active PATH binary**     |
| 6     | `UpdatePSVersionAfter` | Capture post-update versions of both binaries   |
| 7     | `UpdatePSVerify`       | Compare versions and pass/fail the update       |
| 8     | `UpdatePSPostActions`  | Show changelog, run cleanup                     |

| Versions already match           | Sync skipped silently                                        |
| Copy succeeds (Step 2)           | `[OK] Synced successfully.`                                  |
| Copy fails, rename succeeds      | `[OK] Synced via rename fallback.`                           |
| Rename fails, kill+copy succeeds | `[OK] Synced after killing stale processes.`                 |
| All strategies fail              | `[WARN]` with hint to run `gitmap doctor --fix-path`         |
| Deployed binary not found        | Sync skipped (nothing to copy from)                          |
| Active binary not in PATH        | Sync skipped (no target to copy to)                          |
