## Overview

After `setup` (or the bootstrap installer) runs, the user MUST be able
to invoke the CLI **and any of its shell-integrated subcommands** in
the **current terminal session** without restarting it. This spec is
split into focused sub-documents so each concern stays under 200 lines
and is independently auditable by both humans and AI agents.

## Sub-Documents

| File | Scope |
|------|-------|
| [21-post-install-shell-activation/01-contract.md](21-post-install-shell-activation/01-contract.md) | Purpose, required behaviours (PIA-1..PIA-7), activation flow, in-session activation, shell detection, stderr warnings, global constraints. |
| [21-post-install-shell-activation/02-snippets.md](21-post-install-shell-activation/02-snippets.md) | Per-shell profile snippet bodies (PowerShell, Bash, Zsh, Fish), marker conventions, cross-platform parity table. |
| [21-post-install-shell-activation/03-doctor.md](21-post-install-shell-activation/03-doctor.md) | `doctor` wrapper check, three-state detection algorithm, implementation checklist for new CLIs. |
| [21-post-install-shell-activation/04-idempotency.md](21-post-install-shell-activation/04-idempotency.md) | Rewrite & removal algorithms, version-bump rules, testing requirements. |

## Quick Reference

- **Detection variable:** `<TOOL>_WRAPPER=1` (uppercased tool name).
- **Marker prefix:** `# <tool> shell wrapper v<N>`.
- **Marker suffix:** `# <tool> shell wrapper v<N> end`.
- **In-session activation:** PowerShell dot-sources `$PROFILE`; Unix
  shells print a one-liner (child cannot source parent).
- **Doctor states:** `LOADED`, `INSTALLED_BUT_NOT_LOADED`,
  `NOT_INSTALLED`.

## Why This Spec Exists

These bugs in the gitmap project triggered this generic spec:

| Issue | Root Cause |
|-------|------------|
| [22-installer-path-not-active-after-install](../02-app-issues/22-installer-path-not-active-after-install.md) | Installer wrote to PATH but never told the user to reload, and never auto-activated. |
| [24-cd-command-does-not-change-shell-directory](../02-app-issues/24-cd-command-does-not-change-shell-directory.md) | The `cd` subcommand silently no-op'd because the wrapper function was not loaded. |
| [25-powershell-cd-wrapper-not-loaded](../02-app-issues/25-powershell-cd-wrapper-not-loaded.md) | Same as 24 but on Windows — wrapper installed in `$PROFILE` but the running session never sourced it. |

By following the contract above, every new CLI in this framework
inherits a deterministic, AI-implementable post-install activation
flow on day one.
