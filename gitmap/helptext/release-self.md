      ✓ Pushed branch and tag to origin
      Release v2.45.1 complete.
    ✓ Returned to /home/user/projects/other-repo

### Example 2: Auto-fallback when not in a Git repo

    $ cd /tmp
    $ gitmap release --bump minor

**Output:**

    → Self-release: switching to /home/user/go/src/gitmap
    v2.45.0 → v2.46.0
    Creating release v2.46.0...
      ✓ Created branch release/v2.46.0
