# gitmap merge-right

One-way file-level merge that writes only into RIGHT. Files missing
on RIGHT are copied from LEFT; conflicts are resolved into RIGHT.
LEFT is never modified. If RIGHT originated from a URL it is
committed + pushed after the merge.

## Examples

### Example 1: Push LEFT's changes into a remote repo

    gitmap merge-right ./local https://github.com/owner/repo -y

**Output:**

    [merge-right] resolving RIGHT : https://github.com/owner/repo
    [merge-right]   -> folder does not exist; cloning
    [merge-right]   -> clone OK
    [merge-right] diffing trees ...
    [merge-right]   conflict src/app.ts -> took LEFT
    [merge-right] committing in https://github.com/owner/repo ...
    [merge-right]   commit 7a3f9c2 "gitmap merge-right from ./local"
    [merge-right] pushing https://github.com/owner/repo ...
    [merge-right]   push OK
    [merge-right] done

### Example 2: Push to a specific branch

    gitmap mr ./local https://github.com/owner/repo:develop -y

**Output:**

    [merge-right] resolving RIGHT : https://github.com/owner/repo:develop
    [merge-right]   -> folder does not exist; cloning
    [merge-right]   -> clone OK
    [merge-right] pushing https://github.com/owner/repo ...
    [merge-right]   push OK
    [merge-right] done

### Example 3: Stage changes locally without pushing

    gitmap merge-right ./local ./mirror --no-push

**Output:**

    [merge-right] diffing trees ...
    [merge-right]   conflict README.md -> took LEFT
    [merge-right] done

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Resolution, copy, commit, push failed, or user pressed Q |
| 2 | Wrong number of positional arguments |

## Notes

- LEFT is read-only for `merge-right`; no commit or push happens
  on LEFT even when it is a URL endpoint.
- With `-y`, the per-command default is `--prefer-left` (treat
  LEFT as the source of truth being published).
